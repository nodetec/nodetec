# Developer Setup

In this section we will setup our development environment and install the necessary tools to interact with Nostr. 

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, we will need to install a few tools. If you already have these tools installed, you can skip this section.

### Node.js

We will need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to run our applications. You can download the latest version of Node.js from the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/).

### npm

We will need to install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install for the `nostr-tools` package. npm is a package manager for Node.js.


## Initialize Project

We will need to initialize a new Node.js project to install the `nostr-tools` package. To do this, we will initialize a new Node.js project using the `npm init` command.

```bash
npm init
```
