# Developer Setup

In this section we will setup our development environment and install the necessary tools to interact with Nostr. 

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, we will need to install a few tools. If you already have these tools installed, you can skip this section.

### Node.js

We will need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to run our applications. You can download the latest version of Node.js from the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/).

### npm

We will need to install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install for the `nostr-tools` package. npm is a package manager for Node.js. You can install npm by running the following command:

```bash:no-line-numbers
npm install -g npm
```
