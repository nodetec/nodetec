# Vim

If you want to use an improved version of `vi`, then you can try out `vim` (Vi IMproved).

## Install

Here's how to install `vim`:

```sh:Install Vim
sudo apt install vim
```

## Open

To open a file using `vim` you can run the following command:

```sh:Open a File
vim file-name
```

Be sure to replace `file-name` with whatever file you want to open and to include `sudo` before the command if the file requires `sudo` privileges to edit it.

## Save

To save a file you need to be in Command mode which you can enter by pressing the `Esc` key, then type `:w` and press `Enter`.

## Exit

To exit a file you need to be in Command mode which you can enter by pressing the `Esc` key, then type `:q` and press `Enter`.

<Callout client:load type="tip">
  If you want to write and exit the file, then you can combine the above commands into one command by pressing the `Esc` key to enter Command mode then type `:wq` and press `Enter`.
</Callout>
