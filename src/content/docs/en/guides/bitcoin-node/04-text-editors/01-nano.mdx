# Nano

Before proceeding with any configuration for the node, we need to understand at least the basics of how to edit files on the node.

To edit files on the node, we'll need to use a text editor. There are multiple FOSS editors available, e.g., `nano`, `vim`, `nvim`, etc.

We'll demonstrate how to install as well as the basics of using some of these options in the following sections.

We'll also provide resources if you're interested in learning more about a particular text editor.

If you've never used a text editor before, then `nano` is a beginner friendly option.

## Install

It should already be installed on the system, but if not here's how to install it:

```sh:Install Nano
sudo apt install nano
```

## Open

To open a file using `nano` you can run the following command:

```sh:Open a File
nano file-name
```

Be sure to replace `file-name` with whatever file you want to open and to include `sudo` before the command if the file requires `sudo` privileges to edit it.

## Save

To save a file using `nano` press `Ctrl+O`, confirm the file name at the bottom of the editor, and then press the `Enter` key.

## Exit

To exit the editor press `Ctrl+X`.
