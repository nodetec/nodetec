# Network Configuration

We're now going to configure the network of the node. By default the Debian installer configures the system to get the network settings using the **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)** which dynamically assigns IP addresses to devices connected to a network. This means the IP addresses used by devices on the network can change, e.g., if the router and/or the devices are restarted.

When we're attempting to SSH into the node from our client, i.e., our laptop or desktop we may have to first determine the IP address of the node before the connection can be established. To prevent having to potentially determine the IP address of the node when the router and/or device restarts or whenever the DHCP assigns the node a new IP address, we can set a **static IP address** for it by configuring the network.

To perform the network configuration we're first going to determine the **IP address of the node**, the **netmask**, the **network address**, the **broadcast address**, and the **gateway address** which we'll be adding to the `interfaces` file located in the `/etc/network` directory.

To determine these addresses we'll be using the `ip` command which should already be installed.

## Determine Addresses

To determine the IP address of the node, the netmask, the network address, and the gateway address we can run the following command:

```sh:Determine IP Address, Netmask, Network Address, and Gateway Address
ip route show
```

The above command should output something similar to the following:

```sh:ip route show Output
default via 192.168.0.1 dev enp0s3
192.168.0.0/24 dev enp0s3 proto kernel scope link src 192.168.0.100
```

- The gateway address is `192.168.0.1` which is displayed after the `default via` text.

- The network address is `192.168.0.0` which is displayed on the beginning of the second line.

- The network address is postfixed with a `/24` which is the **Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)** notation. This notation is used to indicate the value of the netmask which in this case is `255.255.255.0`.

- The IP address of the node is `192.168.0.100` which is displayed at the end of the second line.

<Callout client:load type="warning">
  The IP address of your node, netmask, network address, and gateway address may be different than the ones provided in the example above, so be sure to use the correct values when configuring the network for your node.
</Callout>

<Callout client:load type="tip">
  If you don't know how to calculate the netmask from the CIDR notation, then you can use this [CIDR to IPv4 Conversion](https://www.ipaddressguide.com/cidr) tool to calculate it. Also, if you're interested in learning more about CIDR, then take a look at [What is CIDR Notation?](https://whatismyipaddress.com/cidr).
</Callout>

To determine the broadcast address we can run the following command:

```sh:Determine Broadcast Address
ip addr show
```

The above command should output something similar to the following:

```sh:ip addr show Output
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 ::1/128 scope host
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
2: enp0s3: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 08:00:27:47:5d:af brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 192.168.0.100/24 brd 192.168.0.255 scope global dynamic enp0s3
       valid_lft 2430sec preferred_lft 2430sec
    inet6 2600:380:9235:9aae:a00:27ff:fe47:5daf/64 scope global dynamic mngtmpaddr
       valid_lft 3480sec preferred_lft 3480sec
    inet6 fe80::a00:27ff:fe47:5daf/64 scope link
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

The `ip addr show` command outputs the active network interfaces.

The first network interface, i.e., `lo` is the loopback interface which is an internal virtual interface used by the computer to communicate with itself.

The second interface, i.e., `enp0s3` is the active Ethernet adapter which the node is using to connect to the internet.

The output of the `enp0s3` interface contains the broadcast address which in this case is `192.168.0.255` and can be found on the line starting with `inet` after the `brb` text.

This command also outputs the IP address of the node postfixed with the CIDR notation, i.e. `192.168.0.100/24` which again is used to indicate the value of the netmask.

<Callout client:load type="warning">
  The adapter name and the broadcast address may be different than the ones provided in the example above, so be sure to use the correct values when configuring the network for your node.
</Callout>

## Edit Network Interfaces

Now that we know the IP address of the node, the netmask, the network address, the broadcast address, and the gateway address, we can edit the `interfaces` file located in the `/etc/network` directory to use a static IP address for the node.

To open the `interfaces` file run the following command:

```sh:Open interfaces File
sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
```

<Callout client:load type="tip">
  You can replace `nano` with your preferred text editor.
</Callout>

Here's the `interfaces` file with DHCP enabled that was generated by the Debian installer:

```sh:interfaces File with DHCP Enabled
# This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
# and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).

source /etc/network/interfaces.d/*

# The loopback network interface
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

# The primary network interface
allow-hotplug enp0s3
iface enp0s3 inet dhcp
```

<Callout client:load type="info">
  Your `interfaces` file may look a little different depending on the network adapters you're using, if you're using IPv6, etc.
</Callout>

Here's the updated `interfaces` file using a static IP address:

```sh:interfaces File with Static IP Address
# This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
# and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).

source /etc/network/interfaces.d/*

# The loopback network interface
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

# The primary network interface
allow-hotplug enp0s3
iface enp0s3 inet static
	address 192.168.0.100
	netmask 255.255.255.0
	network 192.168.0.0
	broadcast 192.168.0.255
	gateway 192.168.0.1
```

Here we replaced `dhcp` with `static` on the line containing `iface enp0s3 inet`, and we added the IP address of the node, the netmask, the network address, the broadcast address, and the gateway address.

<Callout client:load type="warning">
  Be sure to replace the IP address of the node, the netmask, the network address, the broadcast address, and the gateway address with the values you determined for your node.
</Callout>

To prevent having to reboot the system when making changes to the network, we can edit the `interfaces` file by replacing `allow-hotplug` with `auto`.

Here's what the `interfaces` file looks like after adding auto network updates:

```sh:interfaces File with Auto Network Updates
# This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
# and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).

source /etc/network/interfaces.d/*

# The loopback network interface
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

# The primary network interface
auto enp0s3
iface enp0s3 inet static
	address 192.168.0.100
	netmask 255.255.255.0
	network 192.168.0.0
	broadcast 192.168.0.255
	gateway 192.168.0.1
```

## Restart Network

After making the above changes to the `interfaces` file, we can now restart the network by running the following command:

```sh:Restart Network
sudo systemctl restart networking
```

## Hostname

We're now going to discuss how to determine and update your `hostname` in case you set the wrong one or if you want to change it in the future.

The `hostname` was previously set during the installation. To determine the `hostname` you can take a look at the command prompt, i.e., the beginning of each new line in the terminal.

Let's break down the parts of the command prompt, so we can determine the `hostname` of the system from it.

Your command prompt should look something like `username@hostname:~$` where:

- `username` is the name of the currently logged in user, e.g., `satoshi`.

- `@` is a separator between the `username` and `hostname`.

- `hostname` is the `hostname` of the system, e.g., `btc-node`.

- `:` is a separator between the `hostname` and the current working directory.

- `~` represents the home directory of the currently logged in user. This part of the command prompt is used to display the current working directory. If you navigate to a different directory, then this part of the prompt will be updated to display the current working directory.

- `$` is used to indicate that a regular user is logged in, i.e., not a `root` user.  

After breaking down the parts that makeup the command prompt, we're able to determine the `hostname` of the system by looking at the text after the `@` symbol and before the `:` symbol.

Instead of looking at the command prompt, we can also run the following command to determine the `hostname` of the system:

```sh:Determine hostname
hostname
```

The output of the command will be the `hostname` of the system, e.g.,

```sh:hostname Output
btc-node
```

If you want to update the `hostname` of your system, then you can open the `hostname` file located in the `/etc` directory and replace the current `hostname` with your preferred `hostname`.

To open the `hostname` file run the following command:

```sh:Open hostname File
sudo nano /etc/hostname
```

To activate the updated `hostname` run the following command:

```sh:Activate hostname
sudo hostname -F /etc/hostname
```

## Reboot Node

If you updated the `hostname`, then you can reboot the node to update the command prompt and to apply the changes to your node.

To reboot the node run the following the command:

```sh:Reboot Node
sudo systemctl reboot
```

After rebooting the node, the command prompt should now display the updated `hostname`, and the updates we made should be in effect.

## Hosts

We're now going to set up an alias for the node on our client. By setting up an alias we won't have to remember the static IP address of the node when accessing it using SSH.

If you're using a common distribution of Linux on your client, then you should be able to configure the `hosts` file located in the `/etc` directory to use an alias for the static IP address of the node.

To open the `hosts` file on your client run the following command:

```sh:Open hosts File
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```

The `hosts` file on your client should look something like this:

```sh:Initial hosts File
127.0.0.1       localhost
127.0.1.1       client-hostname.localdomain       client-hostname

# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1     localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
```

We're going to update the `hosts` file by adding the alias for the static IP address of the node underneath the line containing the localhost address `127.0.1.1`.

After updating the `hosts` file, it should look something like this:

```sh:Updated hosts File
127.0.0.1       localhost
127.0.1.1       client-hostname.localdomain       client-hostname
192.168.0.100   btc-node.local                    btc-node

# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1     localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
```

Here we're using the static IP address of the node, i.e., `192.168.0.100` along with the `hostname` and the **domain name** of the node as the alias, i.e., `btc-node.local`.

<Callout client:load type="info">
  The domain name of the node was set during the installation as `local`. The domain name of `local` is used to represent the node is on our local network, i.e., home network. As stated in the Debian installer the domain name is the part of your internet address to the right of your `hostname`, and it usually ends in `.com`, `.net`, `.edu`, `.org`, etc. Since we're setting up the node to operate on a home network, we can make somehting up.
</Callout>

<Callout client:load type="warning">
  Be sure to replace the static IP address of the node, i.e., `192.168.0.100`, `btc-node`, and `local` with the static IP address of your node, your `hostname`, and your domain name, respectively. Also, `client-hostname` will be replaced by the `hostname` of your client.
</Callout>

## Check Configuration

To check the network configuration, we can use the `hostname` command to check the values for the static IP address of the node, the `hostname`, the domain name, and the **Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)**.

<Callout client:load type="info">
  The FQDN is a part of the **uniform resource locator (URL)**. It is the full name of an entity in the internet framework and includes the `hostname` and the domain name. Since the node is operating on our home network, it will only be accessible by computers that are on the same network. If you're interested in learning more, then check out [FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name): What It Is, Examples, and More](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/fqdn).
</Callout>

### Static IP Address

To check the static IP address of the node run the following command:

```sh:Check Static IP Address
hostname -I
```

The output of the command should be the static IP address you set for your node, e.g.,

```sh:Static IP Adress
192.168.0.100 2600:380:902d:44d7:a00:27ff:fe47:5daf
```

<Callout client:load type="tip">
  The static IP address of the node is the first part of the output, i.e., `192.168.0.100`.
</Callout>

### hostname

To check the `hostname` you can do what we previously did, i.e., check the command prompt or run the following command:

```sh:Check hostname
hostname
```

The output of the command should be the `hostname` you set for your node, e.g.,

```sh:hostname
btc-node
```

### Domain Name

To check the domain name run the following command:

```sh:Check Domain Name
hostname -d
```

The output of the command should be the domain name you set for your node, e.g.,

```sh:Domain Name
local
```

### FQDN

To check the FQDN run the following command:

```sh:Check FQDN
hostname -f
```

The output of the command should be the FQDN for your node which is determined by the `hostname` and the domain name you set for your node, e.g.,

```sh:FQDN
btc-node.local
```

After setting a static IP address for the node, a `hostname`, and a domain name, and updating the `hosts` file on our client, we're now ready to SSH into the node.
