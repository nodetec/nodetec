# Text Editors

To be able to edit files, we'll need to use a text editor. There are multiple FOSS editors available, e.g., `nano`, `vim`, `nvim`, etc. We'll demonstrate how to install as well as the basics of using some of the options. We'll also provide resources if you're interested in learning more about a particular text editor.

## Nano

If you've never used a text editor before, then `nano` is a beginner friendly option.

### Install

It should already be installed on the system, but if not here's how to install it:

```sh:Install Nano
sudo apt install nano
```

### Open

To open a file using `nano` you can run the following command:

```sh:Open a File
nano file-name
```

Be sure to replace `file-name` with whatever file you want to open and to include `sudo` before the command if the file requires `sudo` privileges to edit it.

### Save

To save a file using `nano` press `Ctrl+O`, confirm the file name at the bottom of the editor, and then press the `Enter` key.

### Exit

To exit the editor press `Ctrl+X`.

## Vim

If you want to use an improved version of `vi`, then you can try out `vim` (Vi IMproved).

### Install

Here's how to install `vim`:

```sh:Install Vim
sudo apt install vim
```

### Open

To open a file using `vim` you can run the following command:

```sh:Open a File
vim file-name
```

Be sure to replace `file-name` with whatever file you want to open and to include `sudo` before the command if the file requires `sudo` privileges to edit it.

### Save

To save a file you need to be in Command mode which you can enter by pressing the `Esc` key, then type `:w` and press `Enter`.

### Exit

To exit a file you need to be in Command mode which you can enter by pressing the `Esc` key, then type `:q` and press `Enter`.

<Callout client:load type="tip">
  If you want to write and exit the file, then you can combine the above commands into one command by pressing the `Esc` key to enter Command mode then type `:wq` and press `Enter`.
</Callout>

## Neovim

If you're interested in using an enhanced version of `vim` that includes more features, then check out `nvim`.

### Install

Here's how to install `nvim`:

```sh:Install Neovim
sudo apt install neovim
```

### Open

To open a file using `nvim` you can run the following command:

```sh:Open a File
nvim file-name
```

Be sure to replace `file-name` with whatever file you want to open and to include `sudo` before the command if the file requires `sudo` privileges to edit it.

### Save

To save a file you need to be in Command mode which you can enter by pressing the `Esc` key, then type `:w` and press `Enter`.

### Exit

To exit a file you need to be in Command mode which you can enter by pressing the `Esc` key, then type `:q` and press `Enter`.

<Callout client:load type="tip">
  If you want to write and exit the file, then you can combine the above commands into one command by pressing the `Esc` key to enter Command mode then type `:wq` and press `Enter`.
</Callout>
