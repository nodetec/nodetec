# Introduction

Become a sovereign member of the Bitcoin network by learning how to build and maintain your own Bitcoin full node.

Don't trust, verify.

## Goal of this Guide

The goal of this guide is to provide you with a detailed step by step technical explanation of how to set up and maintain your own Bitcoin full node.

We'll be running all of the commands and installing all of the software ourselves, minimizing the trust we're placing in others whenever possible, and only be using verifiable, secure, and privacy respecting free and open source software.

Each command you run as well as all of the software you install will be explained to give you a better understanding of what is going on with your node.

## Who is this Guide for?

This guide is aimed at anyone who wants to gain a detailed technical step by step understanding of how to run their own Bitcoin full node.

Since the guide is quite technical it helps to have some prior experience with Linux and Bitcoin, but we'll attempt to explain the what, why, and how of everything we're doing.

So, if you're interested in becoming a sovereign member of the Bitcoin network and learning more about Linux and Bitcoin, then you're in the right place.

## What is a Bitcoin Full Node

The definition of a Bitcoin full node can be ambiguous and can depend on the context it's being discussed in.

To clear up any potential confusion when we say a Bitcoin full node in the context of this guide we mean a node that has downloaded the entire blockchain and has the ability to validate, accept, and relay transactions and blocks.

## Why Run a Bitcoin Full Node?

Here are some benefits to running your own Bitcoin full node:

- Contribute to the decentralization of the Bitcoin network by enforcing the consensus rules you agree with.

- Increase your sovereignty by validating your own Bitcoin transactions. You'll no longer need to depend on someone else to validate your transactions or to tell you what is happening on the network.

- Improve your privacy by connecting your wallets to your own node so you no longer leak your entire transaction history to servers you don't control, mask your IP address using technologies like Tor, utilize CoinJoin implementations to transact privately, and more.

## Features

Your Bitcoin full node will offer the following features:

- Bitcoin: Directly participate in the Bitcoin network in a trustless manner by having the ability to fully validate, accept, and relay transactions and blocks

- Electrum Server: Ability to connect your hardware and software wallets to your own node by using your own server

- Blockchain Explorer: Privately search transactions, blocks, and more using your own blockchain explorer

- Uptime: Services can be continously synced and available

- Access from Anywhere: Use the Tor network to connect to all of your services regardless of where you are

## Sections

The guide will be broken up into three main sections:

1. Hardware: Go over the hardware requirements needed to run the node

2. Operating System (OS): Explanation of how to configure the OS

3. Bitcoin: Download and set up your Bitcoin full node, connect your Electrum server, set up your own blockchain explorer, and more

## Updates

This guide will be updated from time to time to reflect any changes that enhance the explanation, security, and privacy, minimize any trust we're placing in others, and to add new features.

Feel free to make contributions to the guide if you see something that can be improved or if you have a feature you would like to add!

## Future Support

In the future we plan on looking into the possibility of creating guides for other Linux distributions as well as other OS's such as [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/) and [OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org/).
