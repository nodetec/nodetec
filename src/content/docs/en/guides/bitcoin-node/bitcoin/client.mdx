# Client

We're now ready to install the **Bitcoin client software** which each node runs in order to participate in the Bitcoin network. The software is used to download the entire blockchain, verify every transaction that has ever happened, and gives us the ability to validate, accept, and relay transactions and blocks.

Bitcoin client software also serves as a data source for other applications that we'll be installing like the Electrum server, blockchain explorer, etc.

## Bitcoin Core

We'll be using [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org/) for our Bitcoin client software.

### What is Bitcoin Core?

Bitcoin Core is an open source project that maintains and releases the Bitcoin client software "Bitcoin Core" which is the reference implementation for the Bitcoin source code. By reference implementation we mean that other implementations look to Bitcoin Core for standards and guidance on maintaining consensus, upgrading, etc.

Bitcoin Core is FOSS which means:

- Anyone can deploy the software for any use case without any restrictions.

- Anyone is allowed to study how the software works and can modify it according to their needs and preferences.

- Anyone can redistribute the software to anyone at a cost or at no cost.

- Anyone is able to enhance the performance of the software and release the enhancements for the community to benefit at a cost or at no cost.

Bitcoin Core provides Bitcoin client software for botha a full node as well as a wallet. The Bitcoin Core wallet isn't currently recommended for the average user to use as their main wallet, so most users prefer to use wallets provided by other developers.

Here's a link to the Bitcoin Core source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin).

The project also maintains related software like the cryptography library [libsecp256k1](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1) which is an optimized C library for ECDSA signatures and secret/public key operations on the **secp256k1** curve.

Here's a link to other related software currently being maintained by the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/bitcoin-core).

Bitcoin Core is used by the majority of nodes on the Bitcoin network and it allows the nodes to enforce the same ruleset and to achieve consensus. To get the current statistics about the number of nodes, the top versions of Bitcoin client software being run by nodes, the percentage of nodes using Tor, etc. you can check out [Clark Moody's Dashboard](https://bitcoin.clarkmoody.com/dashboard/).

## Download

The latest version of Bitcoin Core can be found on the [Download](https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/) page on the Bitcoin Core website.

Make sure to choose the appropriate download file for your node's architecture. I'll be downloading the **Linux (tgz)** file which is compatible with the AMD64 architecture that my node is using.

At the time of writing the latest version of Bitcoin Core is `25.0` which is the version we'll be downloading. If you want to download an earlier version, then you can visit the [Releases](https://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/) page and download your preferred version. You can also download versions of Bitcoin Core from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases) page.

<Callout client:load type="warning">
  If you download a version of Bitcoin Core from the GitHub Releases page, then be sure to not use the asset links generated by GitHub. You should use the download links provided by Bitcoin Core since they're generated deterministically and signed.
</Callout>

Since our node doesn't have a GUI, we're going to download Bitcoin Core using the `wget` command. Wget is a FOSS non-interactive network downloader which can be used to download files from the internet using HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and HTTP proxies. By non-interactive we mean it can work in the background while a user is not logged in, so you can make a request and disconnect from a system and Wget will still complete the request.

Before downloading Bitcoin Core, we're going to first navigate to the `/tmp` directory which is cleared when the system reboots. We'll be downloading files associated with the verification and installation of Bitcoin Core here because we won't need these files after the installation process is completed.

<Callout client:load type="info">
  If you want to keep the files associated with the verification and installation of Bitcoin Core on our node, then you can download the files in a persistent directory, e.g., the `/home/<username>` directory where `<username>` is the username you set during the installation.
</Callout>

Here's how to navigate to the `/tmp` directory:

```sh:Navigate to tmp
cd /tmp
```

We're now going to set a variable for the current session that will be used to store the version of Bitcoin Core that we're downloading. This will allow us to be able to copy the commands here without having to update the version in the file names (assuming only the version changes in the file names) as well as the ability to execute the commands again by navigating through the command history without having to update the version.

Here's how to set a variable to store the version of Bitcoin Core for the current session:

```sh:Set Version Variable
VERSION="25.0"
```

We're now ready to download Bitcoin Core which can be done by running the following command:

```sh:Download Bitcoin Core
wget https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-$VERSION/bitcoin-$VERSION-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz
```

If the download was successful, then there should now be a `bitcoin-$VERSION-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz` file in whatever directory you ran the `wget` command. In my node's case the file is `bitcoin-25.0-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz`.

<Callout client:load type="warning">
  If you don't agree with the updates in a new version of Bitcoin Core, then be sure to not upgrade your version and to only download a version that you agree with.
