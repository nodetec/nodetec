# Client

We're now ready to install the **Bitcoin client software** which each node runs in order to participate in the Bitcoin network. The software is used to download the entire blockchain, verify every transaction that has ever happened, and gives us the ability to validate, accept, and relay transactions and blocks.

Bitcoin client software also serves as a data source for other applications that we'll be installing like the Electrum server, blockchain explorer, etc.

## Bitcoin Core

We'll be using [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org/) for our Bitcoin client software.

### What is Bitcoin Core?

Bitcoin Core is an open source project that maintains and releases the Bitcoin client software "Bitcoin Core" which is the reference implementation for the Bitcoin source code. By reference implementation we mean that other implementations look to Bitcoin Core for standards and guidance on maintaining consensus, upgrading, etc.

Bitcoin Core is FOSS which means:

- Anyone can deploy the software for any use case without any restrictions.

- Anyone is allowed to study how the software works and can modify it according to their needs and preferences.

- Anyone can redistribute the software to anyone at a cost or at no cost.

- Anyone is able to enhance the performance of the software and release the enhancements for the community to benefit at a cost or at no cost.

Bitcoin Core provides Bitcoin client software for botha a full node as well as a wallet. The Bitcoin Core wallet isn't currently recommended for the average user to use as their main wallet, so most users prefer to use wallets provided by other developers.

Here's a link to the Bitcoin Core source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin).

The project also maintains related software like the cryptography library [libsecp256k1](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1) which is an optimized C library for ECDSA signatures and secret/public key operations on the **secp256k1** curve.

Here's a link to other related software currently being maintained by the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/bitcoin-core).

Bitcoin Core is used by the majority of nodes on the Bitcoin network and it allows the nodes to enforce the same ruleset and to achieve consensus. To get the current statistics about the number of nodes, the top versions of Bitcoin client software being run by nodes, the percentage of nodes using Tor, etc. you can check out [Clark Moody's Dashboard](https://bitcoin.clarkmoody.com/dashboard/).

## Download

The latest version of Bitcoin Core can be found on the [Download](https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/) page on the Bitcoin Core website.

Make sure to choose the appropriate download file for your node's architecture. I'll be downloading the **Linux (tgz)** file which is compatible with the AMD64 architecture that my node is using.

At the time of writing the latest version of Bitcoin Core is `25.0` which is the version we'll be downloading. If you want to download an earlier version, then you can visit the [Releases](https://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/) page and download your preferred version. You can also download versions of Bitcoin Core from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases) page.

<Callout client:load type="warning">
  If you download a version of Bitcoin Core from the GitHub Releases page, then be sure to not use the asset links generated by GitHub. You should use the download links provided by Bitcoin Core since they're generated deterministically and signed.
</Callout>

Since our node doesn't have a GUI, we're going to download Bitcoin Core using the `wget` command. Wget is a FOSS non-interactive network downloader which can be used to download files from the internet using HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and HTTP proxies. By non-interactive we mean it can work in the background while a user is not logged in, so you can make a request and disconnect from a system and Wget will still complete the request.

Before downloading Bitcoin Core, we're going to first navigate to the `/tmp` directory which is cleared when the system reboots. We'll be downloading files associated with the verification and installation of Bitcoin Core here because we won't need these files after the installation process is completed.

<Callout client:load type="info">
  If you want to keep the files associated with the verification and installation of Bitcoin Core on your node, then you can download the files in a persistent directory, e.g., the `/home/<username>` directory where `<username>` is the `username` you set during the installation.
</Callout>

Here's how to navigate to the `/tmp` directory:

```sh:Navigate to tmp
cd /tmp
```

We're now going to set a variable for the current session that will be used to store the version of Bitcoin Core that we're downloading. This will allow us to be able to copy the commands here without having to update the version in the file names (assuming only the version changes in the file names) as well as the ability to execute the commands again by navigating through the command history without having to update the version.

Here's how to set a variable to store the version of Bitcoin Core for the current session:

```sh:Set Version Variable
VERSION="25.0"
```

We're now ready to download Bitcoin Core using Wget by running the following command:

```sh:Download Bitcoin Core
wget https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-$VERSION/bitcoin-$VERSION-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz
```

If the download was successful, then there should now be a `bitcoin-$VERSION-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz` file in whatever directory you ran the `wget` command. In my node's case the file is `bitcoin-25.0-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz`.

Here's how the link provided to the `wget` command can be determined for both the current version of Bitcoin Core as well as any older versions.

To determine the link to provide to the `wget` command for the latest version of Bitcoin Core you can use the following steps:

1. Navigate to the Bitcoin Core [Download](https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/) page.

2. Right-click the Bitcoin Core download file for the node's architecture.

3. Copy the link address.

To determine the link to provide to the `wget` command for older versions of Bitcoin Core you can use the following steps:

1. Navigate to the Bitcoin Core [Releases](https://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/) page.

2. Click on the version you want to download.

3. Click on the index link, i.e., `https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-<version>/` which should be located underneath the Release Notes section where `<version>` should be replaced with whatever version of Bitcoin Core you're downloading.

4. Right-click the Bitcoin Core download file for the node's architecture.

5. Copy the link address.

<Callout client:load type="warning">
  If you don't agree with the updates in a new version of Bitcoin Core, then be sure to not upgrade your version and to only download a version that you agree with.
</Callout>

## Verification

We're now going to verify the authenticity of the Bitcoin Core file we downloaded which minimizes the possibility of us running a compromised version of Bitcoin Core. To verify the authenticity of the file we need to download a checksum file and a signature file for the version of Bitcoin Core we're using. The checksum file is used to check that the file hasn't been corrupted during the downlaod. The signature file is used to check that the hashes in the checksum file haven't been tampered with by ensuring they're the ones created and released by the Bitcoin Core project.

<Callout client:load type="warning">
  If you download a compromised version of Bitcoin Core, then a loss of funds is possible. Be sure to verify the authenticity of yor download.
</Callout>

### Download Verification Files

The checksum and signature files for the latest version of Bitcoin Core can be found on the [Download](https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/) page on the Bitcoin Core website underneath the download files.

Here are links to download the checksum and signature files for Bitcoin Core `25.0` which is the latest version at the time of writing:

- [Bitcoin Core 25.0 SHA256 binary hashes](https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-25.0/SHA256SUMS)

- [Bitcoin Core 25.0 SHA256 hash signatures](https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-25.0/SHA256SUMS.asc)

If you downloaded a different version of Bitcoin Core, then you can follow these steps to download the corresponding checksum and signature files:

1. Navigate to the Bitcoin Core [Releases](https://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/) page.

2. Click on the version you downloaded

3. Click on the index link, i.e., `https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-<version>/` which should be underneath the Release Notes section where `<version>` should be replaced with whatever version of Bitcoin Core you downloaded.

4. Download the checksum and signature files which should have the following names `SHA256SUMS` and `SHA256SUMS.asc`, respectively by clicking on each file. Be sure to download them to the same directory as the Bitcoin Core file.

Again, since our node doesn't have a GUI, we're going to download the checksum and signature files using the `wget` command. The files are going to be downloaded to `/tmp` directory which you should have already navigated to if you're using that directory. We'll also be using the `VERSION` variable that we previously set for the current session.

To download the checksum file we can run the following command:

```sh:Download Bitcoin Core Checksums
wget https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-$VERSION/SHA256SUMS
```

If the download was successful, then there should now be a `SHA256SUMS` file in whatever directory you ran the `wget` command.

To download the signature file we can run the following command:

```sh:Download Bitcoin Core Signatures
wget https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-$VERSION/SHA256SUMS.asc
```

If the download was successful, then there should now be a `SHA256SUMS.asc` file in whatever directory you ran the `wget` command.

<Callout client:load type="tip">
  The checksum and signature file names should be `SHA256SUMS` and `SHA256SUMS.asc`, respectively. If they're given different file extensions and/or different names, then the verificiation process will fail.
</Callout>

Here's how the checksum and signature links provided to the `wget` command can be determined for both the current version of Bitcoin Core as well as any older versions.

To determine the links to provide to the `wget` command for the latest version of Bitcoin Core you can use the following steps:

1. Navigate to the Bitcoin Core [Download](https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/) page.

2. Right-click the SHA256 binary hashes file.

3. Copy the link address.

4. Right-click the SHA256 hash signatures file.

5. Copy the link address.

To determine the links to provide to the `wget` command for older versions of Bitcoin Core you can use the following steps:

1. Navigate to the Bitcoin Core [Releases](https://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/) page.

2. Click on the version you want to download.

3. Click on the index link, i.e., `https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-<version>/` which should be located underneath the Release Notes section where `<version>` should be replaced with whatever version of Bitcoin Core you're downloading.

4. Right-click the checksum file which should have the following name `SHA256SUMS`.

5. Copy the link address.

6. Right-click the signature file which should have the following name `SHA256SUMS.asc`.

7. Copy the link address.

### Required Packages

To perform the verification you’ll need to have `gnupg` installed on the node which should already be installed, but if not here’s how to install it.

#### GnuPG

Run the following command to install `gnupg` on the node:

```sh:Install GnuPG on the Node
sudo apt install -y gnupg
```

### Import Bitcoin Core Signing Key(s)

Bitcoin Core releases are signed by multiple individuals each with a unique public key. The signing keys are used to sign the `SHA256SUMS` file, and in order to recognize the validity of the signatures we need to use `gpg` to import at least one of the Bitcoin Core signing keys.

Many Bitcoin Core developer signing keys can be found on GitHub in the Bitcoin Core `guix.sigs` repository in the [builder-keys](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/guix.sigs/tree/main/builder-keys) directory.

If the node had a GUI, then to import a signing key you could navigate to the `builder-keys` directory, click on a signing key you want to download, e.g., `fanquake.gpg`, then click on the Download button to download the raw file to your device.

After downloading the signing key, you could then import the signing key by running the following command:

```sh:Import Signing Key
gpg --import <signing-key>
```

Here `<signing-key>` would be replaced with the file name of the signing key that you downloaded, e.g., `fanquake.gpg`. Also, when running the command above you should be in the same directory where you downloaded the signing key.

After downloading and importing a signing key you would see output that looks similar to:

```sh:Import Signing Key Output
gpg: key 944D35F9AC3DB76A: 20 signatures not checked due to missing keys
gpg: key 944D35F9AC3DB76A: public key "Michael Ford (bitcoin-otc) fanquake@gmail.com" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1
gpg: marginals needed: 3  completes needed: 1  trust model: pgp
gpg: depth: 0  valid:   1  signed:   0  trust: 0-, 0q, 0n, 0m, 0f, 1u
gpg: next trustdb check due at 2026-04-20
```

Here we see `imported: 1` which means the signing key was successfully imported. The output may also say the signing key was updated, has new signatures, or remained unchanged if it was previously imported.

Since our node doesn't have a GUI, we're going to download the signing key using the `wget` command.

To download a signing key using Wget we can run the following command:

```sh:Download a Bitcoin Core Signing Key
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitcoin-core/guix.sigs/main/builder-keys/<signing-key>
```

Here `<signing-key>` should be replaced with the file name of the signing key that you want to download, e.g., `fanquake.gpg`.

To determine the link to provide to the `wget` command to download a signing key you can use the following steps:

1. Navigate to the [builder-keys](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/guix.sigs/tree/main/builder-keys) directory in the Bitcoin Core `guix.sigs` repository

2. Click on the signing key you want to download.

3. Click on the Raw button to display the file contents.

4. Copy the URL in the browser.

<Callout client:load type="tip">
  If the download is taking a while, then you can force Wget to only look for IPv4 addresses using the `--inet4-only` flag, i.e., `wget --inet4-only https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitcoin-core/guix.sigs/main/builder-keys/<signing-key>`. This prevents Wget from trying to download the file using IPv6 addresses which may time out.
</Callout>

After downloading the signing key using Wget, you can then import the signing key by running the following command:

```sh:Import Signing Key
gpg --import <signing-key>
```

Here `<signing-key>` would be replaced with the file name of the signing key that you downloaded, e.g., `fanquake.gpg`. Also, when running the command above you should be in the same directory where you downloaded the signing key.

After downloading and importing a signing key you would see output that looks similar to:

```sh:Import Signing Key Output
gpg: key 944D35F9AC3DB76A: 20 signatures not checked due to missing keys
gpg: /home/satoshi/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg: trustdb created
gpg: key 944D35F9AC3DB76A: public key "Michael Ford (bitcoin-otc) <fanquake@gmail.com>" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1
gpg: no ultimately trusted keys found
```

Here we see `imported: 1` which means the signing key was successfully imported. The output may also say the signing key was updated, has new signatures, or remained unchanged if it was previously imported.

It's recommended to choose multiple trustworthy individuals from the `builder-keys` directory and import their keys using, e.g., the method we used above. However, that can become tedious since we have to individually download and import each signing key. Also, ideally we would download and import each signing key which makes the process even more tedious.

To get around this we can clone the `guix.sigs` repository and then import all of the signing keys using a single command.

To clone the repository we need to have `git` installed on the node.

We're going to first fetch the information about the latest versions of the packages available for our system by running the following command:

```sh:Update apt
sudo apt update
```

We can now run the following command to install `git` on the node:

```sh:Install Git on the Node
sudo apt install -y git
```

To clone the `guix.sigs` repository we can run the following command:

```sh:Clone guix.sigs Repository
git clone https://github.com/bitcoin-core/guix.sigs
```

We can now run the following command to import all of the signing keys in the `builder-keys` directory:

```sh:Import All Signing Keys
gpg --import guix.sigs/builder-keys/*
```

After downloading and importing all of the signing keys you should see output that looks similar to:

```sh:Import All Signing Keys Output

### Verify the Checksum File

We're now ready to verify the checksum file is signed by a sufficient number of signing keys that we trust and have imported into our keychain.

To verify the checksum file we can run the following command:

```sh:Verify Checksum File
gpg --verify SHA256SUMS.asc
```

You should see the output that looks similar to the following if the verification was successful:

```sh:Checksum Verification Output

```

The command outputs signature checks for each of the public keys that signed the checksums.

Each valid signature will have the following output:

1. A line that shows: `gpg: Good signature from...`, e.g., `gpg: Good signature from "vertiond <vertion@protonmail.com>" [unknown]
`

2. A line displaying `Primary key fingerprint:...`, e.g., `Primary key fingerprint: 28E7 2909 F171 7FE9 6077  54F8 A7BE B262 1678 D37D
`

The output may contain warnings that a public key is not available which means you didn't import all of the keys used to sign the release of Bitcoin Core. As long as you have all of the public keys of signers you trust, this warning can be ignored.

Also, unless you tell GnuPG to trust the key, you’ll see a warning similar to the following:

```sh:GnuPG Trust Warning
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
```

This warning means that the key is not certified by another third party authority. If the downloaded file was a fake, then the signature verification process would fail and you would be warned that the fingerprints don’t match.

When you get a warning like this it’s also good practice to check some or all of the keys against other sources.

E.g., to check Andrew Chow's primary key fingerprint we could navigate to [Andrew Chow's Keybase](https://keybase.io/achow101), click on his public key, i.e., the line that says `1756 5732 E08E 5E41` to view the primary key fingerprint, and then check that it matches the primary key fingerprint we have.

### Verify Bitcoin Core File

We can now verify the Bitcoin Core file we downloaded by recomputing the `SHA256` hash of the file, compare it with the corresponding hash in the `SHA256SUMS` file, and ensure they match exactly by running the following command:

```sh:Verify Bitcoin Core File
sha256sum --ignore-missing --check SHA256SUMS
```

If the verification was successful you should see output similar to the following:

```sh:Bitcoin Core File Verification Output
bitcoin-xx.xx.xx-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz: OK
```

Where the `xx.xx.xx` is replaced by whatever version of Bitcoin Core you're verifying, e.g., `25.0`, and `x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz` is replaced by whatever architecture you're using and whatever file type you downloaded.

Any warnings and/or failures in the output can be safely ignored as long as the output displays `OK` after the name of the Bitcoin Core file you're verifying, e.g., `bitcoin-25.0-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz: OK`.

<Callout client:load type="info">
  The `SHA256SUMS` file contains checksums for other architectures supported by Bitcoin Core which we didn't download, e.g., `riscv64`. This is why we're using the `--ignore-missing` flag which allows us to ignore any output associated with any files that are missing.
