# Configuration

We're now going to create and edit the Bitcoin config file which is used by the following Bticoin Core excutables `bitcoind`, `bitcoin-qt`, and `bitcoin-cli`.

## Bitcoin Core Executables

Here's a brief description of each of those executables:

- `bitcoind`: Is a headless daemon, i.e., a program that runs as a background process without a GUI implementation of the Bitcoin protocol that provides a **JSON-RPC** interface, i.e., an RPC protocol encoded in **JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)** which allows it to be controlled by local or remote devices. We'll be using `bitcoind` to sync and validate the Bitcoin blockchain and to run the Bitcoin protocol.

- `bitcoin-qt`: Is an implementation of the Bitcoin protocol that provides a GUI which offers a visual representation of the node and wallet functionality provided by Bitcoin Core. The suffix `qt` is derived from the FOSS GUI toolkit [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) which is used to build `bitcoin-qt`. Since our node isn't using a GUI, we won't be using `bitcoin-qt`.

- `bitcoin-cli`: Is a CLI for Bitcoin Core that connects to a running instance of `bitcoind`. This program can be used to interact with `bitcoind` to control the node and wallet functionality provided by Bitcoin Core. We'll be using `bitcoin-cli` throughout this guide to interact with the node.

The configuration used by `bitcoind` and `bitcoin-qt` are compatible. They both use the same command line arguments, the same config file, and use the same data files when reading and writing.

<Callout client:load type="tip">
Even though `bicoind` and `bitcoin-qt` are compatible in their configuration, only one can be run at a time. If you're running one of them, then you'll need to stop it before being able to run the other.
</Callout>

<Callout client:load type="warning">
  While it's possible to quickly start `bitcoind` or `bitcoin-qt` using the default configuration by running `./bitcoind` or `./bitcoin-qt`, respectively, it's recommended to check the configuration and set any options that will increase your security and privacy.
</Callout>

## Create Bitcoin Config File

The Bitcoin config file is not automatically created when installing Bitcoin Core, so we can create the file manually.

Before creating the file be sure you're using the user you set up to use with Bitcoin Core, e.g., the `bitcoin` user we created in the previous section.

If you're not currently using the Bitcoin user, then you can switch to it by running the following command:

```sh:Switch to Bitcoin User
sudo su - <username>
```

Here `<username>` refers to the username you're using with Bitcoin Core.

E.g., to switch to my node's Bitcoin Core user I would run the following command:

```sh:Switch to bitcoin User
sudo su - bitcoin
```

Now we're ready to create and open the config file which we can do by running the following command:

```sh:Create and Open bitcoin.conf
nano $HOME/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf
```

The default name used for the config file is `bitcoin.conf`, and the default location is the Bitcoin data directory.

<Callout client:load type="tip">
  Both the config file path and the Bitcoin data directory can be changed by using the command line options `-conf` and `-datadir`, respectively. The `-conf` option is only useable from the command line, i.e., it cannot be used in the config file. The `-conf` option will also use a relative path prefixed by the value of the `-datadir` option unless an absolute path is provided.
</Callout>

## Bitcoin Config File Format

The Bitcoin config file is a plain text file that consists of entries in the following format:

- `option=value`

Here `option` represents the Bitcoin option we're configuring and `value` represents the value we're assigning to that option.

Each entry or option is placed on its own line, and all of the leading and trailing whitespaces are removed by the Bitcoin config file parser.

As opposed to setting config options using the command line, options set in the Bitcoin config file must following these rules:

- Each option must be specified withought a leading `-`.
- Each option is required to have value.

E.g., the `noconnect` option must be specified using the following format in the Bitcoin config file `noconnect=1`; whereas on the command line it can be specified as `-noconnect`.

### Blank Lines

Blank lines are also allowed and are ignored by the Bitcoin config file parser.

### Comments

Comments start with a `#` and extend to the end of a line.

All comments are ignored by the Bitcoin config file parser.

Comments may appear in two ways:

- On their own line (preferable)

- After an `option=value` entry

## Edit Bitcoin Config File

We're now going to add the following lines to the Bitcoin config file:

```sh:Bitcoin Config File Updates
server=1
txindex=1

proxy=127.0.0.1:9050
bind=127.0.0.1
listen=1

rpcauth=<userpw>

maxconnections=<n>
maxuploadtarget=<n>

dbcache=<n>
blocksonly=1
```

Here's an explanation of the updates we made to the Bitcoin config file:

- `server=1`: Allows `bitcoind` to accept command line and JSON-RPC commands.

- `txindex=1`: Maintains a full transaction index, and is used by the `getrawtransaction` RPC. The default value for this option is `0`, so it's disabled by default. You cannot have this option enabled if you're planning on running a pruned node, i.e., a node that doesn't download the entire blockchain.

- `proxy=127.0.0.1:9050`: Specifies the IP address and the port number to use with a SOCKS5 proxy in the format `<ip:port>`. Here we set the value to be `127.0.0.1:9050` which is the default SOCKS5 proxy Tor is listening on. The proxy server will be used to reach `.onion` addresses as well. This option is disabled by default.

- `bind=127.0.0.1`: Bind to the provided IP address and always listen on it. Here we set the value to be `127.0.0.1` which is the IP address being used by Tor. The default value is `0.0.0.0`

- `listen=1`: Determines if connections from outside of the node are allowed. The default value is `1`, so normally we wouldn't need to explicity set it. However, since we're using the `proxy` option, listening gets disabled. Therefore, we need to explicitly set it.

- `rpcauth=<userpw>`: Specifies the username and HMAC-SHA-256 hashed password for JSON-RPC connections. The value of `<userpw>` is provided in the format `<username>:<salt>$<hash>`. Here `<userpw>` should be replaced with your RPC username and the generated salt and hash of the your RCP password which we generated in the previous section using the `rpcauth.py` script. After setting this value, Bitcoin Core then connects normally using the `rpcuser=<username>` option, i.e., the username for JSON-RPC connections, and the `rpcpassword=<password>` option, i.e., the password for JSON-RPC connections.

- `maxconnections=<n>`: Specifies the maximum number of incoming connections to establish with peers simultaneously. The default value is `125`. If your node has limited resources and you're having issues, then you can try decreasing this number to conserve resources. If your node has enough resources to handle the default number of  `maxconnections`, then it's recommended to leave the value as the default. This limit doesn't apply to manually addded connections, i.e., connections added using the `addnode` option or the `addnode` RPC which has a default limit of `8`.

- `maxuploadtarget=<n>`: Specifies the preferred target over a 24 hour span to keep the outbound traffic under. The default value is `0M` which specifies no limit. If your node has limited resources and you're having issues, then you can try decreasing this number to conserve resources. Otherwise, it's recommended to keep this value at the default value. The limit doesn't apply to peers that have been granted a `download` permission by whitelisting their IP address or blocks created in the past week. Optional suffix units include `k, K, m, M, g, G, t, and T` where lowercase represents the 1000 base and uppercase represents 1024 base, e.g., 1k = 1000 bytes and 1K = 1024 bytes.

- `dbcache=<n>`: Specifies the maximum database cache size in `MiB`. The value can be between `4` and `16384`, and the default value is `450`. In addition to the value set here any unused mempool memory is shared with this cache. The default `maxmempool` option has a default value of `300MB`, so if the mempool memory is currently using less memory than the `300MB` the remaining memory gets used by the database cache. To increase the initial download speed of the blockchain you can increase this value to be anywhere from a quarter to up to at least half of your node's RAM. E.g., if your node has `4GB` of RAM you can initially set this value to be `2000`. After syncing the entire blockchain, you can reduce the value to the default size to free up some of the node's RAM which will allow other applications to be able to run in parallel on the node. However, if your node has sufficient RAM, then you can increase this value as much as your hardware allows to reduce the number of disk operations done by your node and to incerase your node's speed when accessing the database.

- `blocksonly=1`: Specifies whether to reject transactions from network peers by disabling transaction relaying. The default value for this option is `0`. This option reduces the incoming bandwidth to a node since it no longer participates in transaction relaying. Automatic broadcast and rebroadcast of any transactions from inbound peers is disabled, unless the peer has been granted the `relay` permission by whitelisting their IP address. The node will disconnect from any peers that attempt to relay a transaction without being granted the proper permissions. RPC transactions are not affected. This setting will increase the initial download speed of the blockchain since the node's bandwidth is no longer concerned with transaction relaying. After syncing the entire blockchain, we're going to set `blocksonly` back to `0` since we'll want to be able to relay the transactions of network peers.

If `bitcoind` or `bitcoin-qt` are currently running, then changes made to the config file will only take effect after retarting them.

Also, any options set using the command line will override the corresponding values set in the Bitcoin config file.

<Callout client:load type="tip">
  All command line options except for `-?`, `-help`, `-version`, and `-conf` can be specified in the config file, and all config file options except for `includeconf` can be specified on the command line.
</Callout>

<Callout client:load type="tip">
  It's possible to get a list of all of the Bitcoin config file options including explanations about the options by running the following command `bitcoind -?`. You can also view a default `bitcoin.conf` file located in whatever directory you extracted the Bitcoin Core files to in the `bitcoin-<version>` directory where `<version>` should be replaced by whatever version of Bitcoin Core you downloaded. This default `bitcoin.conf` file is generated by the `gen-bitcoin-conf.sh` script which can be found at [contrib/devtools/gen-bitcoin-bitcoin-conf.sh](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/contrib/devtools/gen-bitcoin-conf.sh) in the bitcoin repository.

## Transaction Index Explanation

By default Bitcoin Core builds a transaction index consisting of only the transactions related to the user's wallets including **watch-only wallets**, i.e., a wallet that allows users to keep track of their Bitcoin in cold storage while disabling the ability to spend funds. Bitcoin Core will also maintain transaction data related to the node's **memory pool (mempool)**, i.e., a list of pending transactions waiting for validation from the network before being committed to a block in the blockchain.

To be able to access any transaction with a command like `getrawtransaction` we need to configure Bitcoin Core to build and maintain a full transaction index which we did above by setting the `txindex` option to a value of `1`.

You may not need to build and maintain a full transaction index if you're planning on using the node for only your own personal wallet.

However, if you're planning on using your node for development, blockchian analysis, and/or any application that requires a full transaction index to run properly, e.g., some wallets and blockchain explorers, then you'll need to set `txindex=1` to be able to get transaction data for any transaction in the blockchain.

The tradeoff of setting `txindex=1` is it makes the node slightly slower as well as increases the storage requirements for the node.

You also cannot set `txindex=1` if you're planning on running a pruned node, i.e., a node that doesn't download the entire blockchain.

## Maximum Connections Explanation

The `maxconnections` option specifies the maximum number of incoming connections to establish with peers simultaneously. The default value is `125`.

If your node has enough resources to handle the default number of  `maxconnections`, then it's recommended to leave the value as the default.

It's recommended to not try to max out your node's number of incoming connections since other nodes that are looking for the minimum number of peers to connect to will be unable to connect to your node. Connectable peers on the network can be a scarce resource and are essential to the decentralization of the network.

Having more connections doesn't result in stronger verification or faster relaying. It actually slows down the relaying since your node will have to distribute new blocks and transactions to your increased number of peers.

If your node has limited resources and you're having issues, then you can try decreasing this number to conserve resources.

Also, note this limit doesn't apply to manually addded connections, i.e., connections added using the `addnode` option or the `addnode` RPC which has a default limit of `8`.

## Network Explanation

When using Bitcoin Core with Tor it will usually only be able to make outgoing connections. To enable incoming connections over Tor which helps improve the security and privacy of the Bitcoin network, we can run a Tor hidden service on the node.

We previously enabled Tor to listen for connections on the control port, i.e., `9051` which is used to set up an automatic Tor hidden service that is initiated by Bitcoin Core.

Bitcoin Core will automatically attempt to use Tor's control socket API to create and destroy ephemeral, i.e., short-lived onion services programmatically.

Therefore, if Tor is running with authentication properly configured, then Bitcoin Core will automatically create an onion service to listen for incoming connections over Tor assuming Bitcoin Core is configured to listen to and accept connections from outside of the node, i.e., the `listen` option is set to a value `1`.

The ability to automically detect and use Tor's control socket API to create a Bitcoin Core onion service is enabled by default by the `listenonion` option which has a default value of `1`.

### Authentication

Bitcoin Core offers two methods of authentication to be able to connect to Tor's control socket API:

- **Cookie Authentication**: To enable this method the user running `bitcoind`, e.g., `bitcoin` must have read access to the `CookieAuthFile` specified in the `/etc/tor/torrc` config file or in the default location in the `/run/tor/control.authcookie` file. We previously enabled read access to the `CookieAuthFile` for the user running `bitcoind` when we addded the `bitcoin` user to the `debian-tor` group.

- **Password Authentication**: To enable this method you would use the plaintext of the control password that was used when generating the hashed password for the `HashedControlPassword` option in the `/etc/tor/torrc` file. The plaintext of the control password would be provided to the `torpassword` option in the Bitcoin config file. Since we didn't generate a Tor control password, we're not using this option.

The Tor control port that Bitcoin Core connects to is specified by the `torcontrol` option which is specified in the format `<ip>:<port>`. This option has a default value of `127.0.0.1:9051` which is the control port we previously enabled in the `/etc/tor/torrc` config file.

### Onion Service

After enabling the Tor control port to listen on `127.0.0.1:9051` using the Cookie Authentication method with the `bitcoin` user given read access to the `CookieAuthFile`, `bitcoind` will generate a file called `onion_private_key` in the Bitcoin data directory when there is no file with that name present in the directory.

The `onion_private_key` file contains the private key needed to generate the hostname of the onion service used by Bitcoin Core, i.e., the onion address.

<Callout client:load type="warning">
  The public and private keys associated with the Bitcoin Core onion service need to be kept private. If the keys are leaked, then othen other people can impersonate the onion service which means it's now compromised, useless, and dangerous to use.
</Callout>

If we delete the keys associated with the Bitcoin Core onion service, then the next time `bitcoind` loads it will generate new keys and derive a new onion address.

<Callout client:load type="warning">
  An attacker cannot necessarily associate the onion address used by the onion service with a specific person or group; however, as long as the onion address remains the same an attacker can assume it's being run by the same person or group. This is why it's important to keep onion addresses private as well when we're using them for our own internal needs. However, to allow incoming Tor connections we need to share the onion address with the rest of the Bitcoin network.
</Callout>

<Callout client:load type="tip">
  To achieve a higher level of security and privacy its recommended to delete the keys associated with the Bitcoin Core onion address on each reboot or on some frequent interval.
</Callout>

After performing the configuration above the node will now be able to accept incoming and outgoing connections over the Tor network.

### Tor Proxy

By default Bitcoin Core will usually connect over clearnet as well as allow connections to and from the Tor hidden service we've configured.

After configuring the Bitcoin Core onion service, we're now helping other users who want to submit transactions to the Bitcoin newtork securely and privately. However, the transactions we submit can potentially be traced back to our node's IP address since our node still currently allows transactions we submit to be over clearnet.

To ensure Bitcoin Core always uses Tor when connecting to other nodes we added the following options to the Bitcoin config file:

- `proxy`

- `bind`

- `listen`

As mentioned above the `proxy` option allows us to specify the IP address and the port number to use with a SOCKS5 proxy in the format `<ip:port>`. Again we set the value to be `127.0.0.1:9050` which is the default SOCKS5 proxy Tor is listening on. The proxy server will be used to reach `.onion` addresses as well.

Again, the `bind` option is used to bind the provided IP address and to always listen on it. Here we set the value to be `127.0.0.1` which is the IP address being used by the Tor proxy. This mitigates the possibility of our node establsihing a clearnet connection with another node without using Tor as a proxy.

Since we set the `proxy` option, Bitcoin Core will once again not listen for and accept connections from outside of the node which is why we're explicitly setting the `listen` option to a value of `1`.

### Onion Only Network

If you additionally want Bitcoin Core automatic outbound connections to only connect to Tor hidden services, then you can also add this line to the Bitcoin config file:

```sh:Set Onion Only Network
onlynet=onion
```

By setting the `onlynet` option to have a value of `onion` this makes your node more secure and private since it will never establish an outbound connection without using the Tor hidden service. However, your node will be unable to connect to any of the clearnet nodes.

If everyone used this configuration, then nobody on the onion Bitcoin network would be able to communicate with the clearnet Bitcoin network. Therefore, it's essential that some nodes access both Tor and clearnet.

enable incoming connections over Tor

If you just want to enable incoming connections to your node over Tor to provide more security and privacy for other Tor users, then you shouldn't set this value. On the other hand, if you need to submit Bitcon transactions with a higher level of obscurity, then you should use `onlynet=onion`.

<Callout client:load type="warning">
  Inbound and manual connections are not affected by the `onlynet` option, so if you don't want to enable clearnet connections, then be sure to remove any manual clearnet connections you may have added in your Bitcoin config file.
</Callout>

### Privacy Recommendations

The onion service being used by Bitcoin Core should not be reused by any other service being run on the node, e.g., a web service.

You should create a new onion service for any other service that you want to use on your node.

If you use the same onion service for Bitcoin Core and some other service running on your node, then the traffic between the services can be linked.

Also, note that automatic onion services created by Bitcoin Core always have only one port open.
