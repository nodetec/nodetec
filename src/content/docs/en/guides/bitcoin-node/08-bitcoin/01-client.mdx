# Client

We're now ready to install the **Bitcoin client software** which each node runs in order to participate in the Bitcoin network. The software is used to download the entire blockchain, verify every transaction that has ever happened, and gives us the ability to validate, accept, and relay transactions and blocks.

Bitcoin client software also serves as a data source for other applications that we'll be installing like the Electrum server, blockchain explorer, etc.

## Bitcoin Core

We'll be using [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org/) for our Bitcoin client software.

### What is Bitcoin Core?

Bitcoin Core is an open source project that maintains and releases the Bitcoin client software "Bitcoin Core" which is the reference implementation for the Bitcoin source code. By reference implementation we mean that other implementations look to Bitcoin Core for standards and guidance on maintaining consensus, upgrading, etc.

Bitcoin Core is FOSS which means:

- Anyone can deploy the software for any use case without any restrictions.

- Anyone is allowed to study how the software works and can modify it according to their needs and preferences.

- Anyone can redistribute the software to anyone at a cost or at no cost.

- Anyone is able to enhance the performance of the software and release the enhancements for the community to benefit at a cost or at no cost.

Bitcoin Core provides Bitcoin client software for botha a full node as well as a wallet. The Bitcoin Core wallet isn't currently recommended for the average user to use as their main wallet, so most users prefer to use wallets provided by other developers.

Here's a link to the Bitcoin Core source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin).

The project also maintains related software like the cryptography library [libsecp256k1](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1) which is an optimized C library for ECDSA signatures and secret/public key operations on the **secp256k1** curve.

Here's a link to other related software currently being maintained by the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/bitcoin-core).

Bitcoin Core is used by the majority of nodes on the Bitcoin network and it allows the nodes to enforce the same ruleset and to achieve consensus. To get the current statistics about the number of nodes, the top versions of Bitcoin client software being run by nodes, the percentage of nodes using Tor, etc. you can check out [Clark Moody's Dashboard](https://bitcoin.clarkmoody.com/dashboard/).
