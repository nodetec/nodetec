# Download

The latest version of Bitcoin Core can be found on the [Download](https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/) page on the Bitcoin Core website.

Make sure to choose the appropriate download file for your node's architecture. I'll be downloading the **Linux (tgz)** file which is compatible with the AMD64 architecture that my node is using.

At the time of writing the latest version of Bitcoin Core is `25.0` which is the version we'll be downloading. If you want to download an earlier version, then you can visit the [Releases](https://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/) page and download your preferred version. You can also download versions of Bitcoin Core from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases) page.

<Callout client:load type="warning">
  If you download a version of Bitcoin Core from the GitHub Releases page, then be sure to not use the asset links generated by GitHub. You should use the download links provided by Bitcoin Core since they're generated deterministically and signed.

Since our node doesn't have a GUI, we're going to download Bitcoin Core using the `wget` command. Wget is a FOSS non-interactive network downloader which can be used to download files from the internet using HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and HTTP proxies. By non-interactive we mean it can work in the background while a user is not logged in, so you can make a request and disconnect from a system and Wget will still complete the request.

Before downloading Bitcoin Core, we're going to first navigate to the `/tmp` directory which is cleared when the system reboots. We'll be downloading files associated with the verification and installation of Bitcoin Core here because we won't need these files after the installation process is completed.

<Callout client:load type="info">
  If you want to keep the files associated with the verification and installation of Bitcoin Core on your node, then you can download the files in a persistent directory, e.g., the `/home/<username>` directory where `<username>` is the `username` you set during the installation.
</Callout>

Here's how to navigate to the `/tmp` directory:

```sh:Navigate to tmp
cd /tmp
```

We're now going to set a variable for the current session that will be used to store the version of Bitcoin Core that we're downloading. This will allow us to be able to copy the commands here without having to update the version in the file names (assuming only the version changes in the file names) as well as the ability to execute the commands again by navigating through the command history without having to update the version.

Here's how to set a variable to store the version of Bitcoin Core for the current session:

```sh:Set Version Variable
VERSION="25.0"
```

We're now ready to download Bitcoin Core using Wget by running the following command:

```sh:Download Bitcoin Core
wget https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-$VERSION/bitcoin-$VERSION-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz
```

If the download was successful, then there should now be a `bitcoin-$VERSION-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz` file in whatever directory you ran the `wget` command. In my node's case the file is `bitcoin-25.0-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz`.

Here's how the link provided to the `wget` command can be determined for both the current version of Bitcoin Core as well as any other version.

To determine the link to provide to the `wget` command for the latest version of Bitcoin Core you can use the following steps:

1. Navigate to the Bitcoin Core [Download](https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/) page.

2. Right-click the Bitcoin Core download file for the node's architecture.

3. Copy the link address.

To determine the link to provide to the `wget` command for any version of Bitcoin Core you can use the following steps:

1. Navigate to the Bitcoin Core [Releases](https://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/) page.

2. Click on the version you want to download.

3. Click on the index link, i.e., `https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-<version>/` which should be located underneath the Release Notes section where `<version>` should be replaced with whatever version of Bitcoin Core you're downloading.

4. Right-click the Bitcoin Core download file for the node's architecture.

5. Copy the link address.

  If you don't agree with the updates in a new version of Bitcoin Core, then be sure to not upgrade your version and to only download a version that you agree with.
