# Extraction

Now that we have successfully verified the checksum file, the Bitcoin Core file, and validated the timestamp proof, we're ready to extract, install, and configure Bitcoin Core on our node.

## Required Packages

To extract the Bitcoin Core files you'll need to have `tar` installed on the node which should already be installed, but if not here's how to install it.

### tar

Run the following command to install `tar` on the node:

```sh:Install tar
sudo apt install -y tar
```

## Extract Bitcoin Core Files

To extract the Bitcoin Core files from the `.tar.gz` file we downloaded we can run the following command:

```sh:Extract Bitcoin Core Files
tar -xvzf bitcoin-$VERSION-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz
```

Here's an explanation of the options we passed to the `tar` command:

- `-x`: This option specifies that we want to extract the contents of the archive, i.e., the `.tar.gz` file.

- `-v`: This option specifies that we would like to see the verbose output which means we'll be displayed a list of all of the files being extracted.

- `-z`: This option specifies that we would like to decompress the arcive using GZIP.

- `-f`: This option specifies the archive file that we would like to extract.

The output should look similar to the following:

```sh:Bitcoin Core Extraction Output
bitcoin-25.0/
bitcoin-25.0/README.md
bitcoin-25.0/bin/
bitcoin-25.0/bin/bitcoin-cli
bitcoin-25.0/bin/bitcoin-qt

bitcoin-25.0/bin/bitcoin-util

bitcoin-25.0/share/man/
bitcoin-25.0/share/man/man1/
bitcoin-25.0/share/man/man1/bitcoin-cli.1
bitcoin-25.0/share/man/man1/bitcoin-qt.1
bitcoin-25.0/share/man/man1/bitcoin-tx.1
bitcoin-25.0/share/man/man1/bitcoin-util.1
bitcoin-25.0/share/man/man1/bitcoin-wallet.1
bitcoin-25.0/share/man/man1/bitcoind.1
bitcoin-25.0/share/rpcauth/
bitcoin-25.0/share/rpcauth/README.md
bitcoin-25.0/share/rpcauth/rpcauth.py
```

The extraction output displays a list of all of the files and directories contained in the `bitcoin-$VERSION-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz` file we downloaded.

## Bitcoin Core Files

After the extraction is completed a `bitcoin-<version>` directory will be created in whatever directory you extracted the files to where `<version>` should be replaced with whatever version of Bitcoin Core you downloaded.

We can navigate to the `bitcoin-<version>` directory by running the following command:

```sh:Navigate to bitcoin-<version> Directory
cd bitcoin-<version>
```

E.g., to navigate to the `bitcoin-25.0` on my node I would run the following command:

```sh:Navigate to bitcoin-25.0 Directory on My Node
cd bitcoin-25.0
```

To see all of the files and directories in the `bitcoin-<version>` directory we can run the following command:

```sh:List Directory Content
ls
```

The output of the command should look something like this:

```sh:bitcoin-<version> Directory Content
bin  bitcoin.conf  include  lib  README.md  share
```
