# Devices

You can run a node on various devices including a desktop, laptop, single-board computer (SBC), or a mini PC as long as the device meets the low-end recommendations.

You can also run a node on devices that you use for other things, but ideally it's being run on a dedicated device which improves the security and reliability of the node.

If you plan to follow along with this guide, then you need to make sure whatever hardware you use supports [Debian](https://www.debian.org/).

<Callout client:load type="tip">
  This guide will also work with a virtual machine (VM) running Debian. This set up can be useful if your hardware doesn't support Debian directly, or if you want to test things out before setting up the node on bare metal.

## Device Recommendations

Here are some recommendations for desktops, laptops, SBCs, and mini PCs made by companies that attempt to use free and open source hardware (FOSH) and free and open source software (FOSS) when possible.

- [PINE64](https://www.pine64.org/)

- [Purism](https://puri.sm/)

- [System76](https://system76.com/)

<Callout client:load type="warning">
  While you can run your node on a [Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) the hardware and firmware is closed source and has potential security issues. If you're looking to run your node on an SBC, then it may be worth taking a look at using some alternatives like the [ROCKPro64](https://www.pine64.org/rockpro64/) or a [ROCK 4](https://wiki.radxa.com/Rock4) SBC.

If you have any recommendations for desktops, laptops, SBCs, mini PCs, and/or hardware parts that use FOSH and FOSS whenever possbile let us know through one of our community channels.
