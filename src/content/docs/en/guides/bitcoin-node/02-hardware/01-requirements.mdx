# Requirements

To be able to run a Bitcoin full node you need to meet certain hardware requirements. We'll provide the current low-end, mid-range, and high-end recommendations to run a full node.

If you only meet the low-end recommendations you'll be able to set up and run the node. However, it's more likely you'll run into issues while running your node, and you'll need to upgrade some or all of the parts sooner rather than later.

With that being said if you can't afford the mid-range or high-end hardware, are unable to gain access to it, or if you just want to learn, then it's fine to continue with just the low-end recommendations.

While using the high-end hardware will make setting up and running your node a seamless experience as well as future proof your node.

  These recommendations are based on the statistics of the Bitcoin network at the time of writing as well as pre-built nodes that are in use today. To get current statistics about the Bitcoin network you can check out [Clark Moody's Dashboard](https://bitcoin.clarkmoody.com/dashboard/). In the future we plan on testing some or all of these recommendations to potentially improve them as well as to help users troubleshoot any issues they run into.
