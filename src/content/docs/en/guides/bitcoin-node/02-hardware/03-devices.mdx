# Devices

You can run a node on various devices including a **single-board computer (SBC)**, a **mini PC**, a **laptop**, or a **desktop** as long as the device meets the previously mentioned low-end recommendations.

You can also run a node on devices that you use for other things, but ideally it's being run on a dedicated device which improves the privacy, security, and reliability of the node.

If you plan to follow along with this guide, then you need to make sure whatever hardware you use supports [Debian](https://www.debian.org/).

<Callout client:load type="tip">
  If you’re using the Tor Browser, then you can access Debian’s website using the following onion address [5ekxbftvqg26oir5wle3p27ax3wksbxcecnm6oemju7bjra2pn26s3qd.onion](http://5ekxbftvqg26oir5wle3p27ax3wksbxcecnm6oemju7bjra2pn26s3qd.onion/).
</Callout>

<Callout client:load type="tip">
  This guide will also work with a virtual machine (VM) running Debian. This set up can be useful if your hardware doesn't support Debian directly, or if you want to test things out before setting up the node on bare metal.
</Callout>

## Free and Open Source Hardware

Even if a device is running a **free and open source (FOSS)** **Operating System (OS)**, it doesn't mean the hardware or the firmware used by each component that makes up the device is free and open source.

**Free and open source hardware (FOSH)** also known as **free-design hardware** is a set of design principles and practices where all of the data about the hardware is made publicly available, and the users of the hardware are free to use the design of the hardware, i.e., fabricate their own hardware from the design, copy the design, study the design, modify the design by making any changes, and redistribute the design with or without changes.

The data that needs to be publicly available and that needs to meet the criteria discussed above includes the following:

- Schematics

- Blueprints

- Design files

- Mechanical drawings

- Computer Aided Design (CAD) drawings and files

- Printed Circuit Board (PCB) layouts

- Integrated Circuit (IC) layouts

- Bill of Materials (BOMs)

- Manufacturing documents

- Hardware Description Language (HDL) source code

- Other source code used by the hardware to function, e.g., firmware

- Reference manuals

- etc.

<Callout client:load type="warning">
  FOSH is still a relatively new development, so it's not currently feasible to obtain a device that doesn't rely on some form of proprietary hardware and proprietary firmware, e.g., most keyboards, cameras, disk drives, universial serial buses (USBs), etc. As FOSH develops and becomes more feasible to obtain the recommended companies and devices provided here will be updated accordingly.
</Callout>

<Callout client:load type="info">
  If you're interested in learning more about FOSH, then check out [Free Hardware and Free Hardware Designs](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-hardware-designs.en.html), [Open Source Hardware Association (OSHWA)](https://www.oshwa.org/), [What is open hardware?](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-hardware), [Open-source hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_hardware), , and [Open source hardware](https://opensource.fandom.com/wiki/Open_source_hardware).
</Callout>

## Company Criteria

When looking for a company to purchase the hardware from to assemble the node the following criteria should be taken into consideration:

- **Free and Open Source Hardware (FOSH) and Free Open Source Software (FOSS)**: This refers to a company's commitment to producing FOSH and FOSS whenever possible and their attempts to be as transparent as possible about the operation, designing, manufacturing, distribution, etc. processes associated with their company.

- **Jurisdiction**: Here we're referring to the location(s) a company uses. These locations include where a company's operation, designing, manufacturing, order processing, distribution, etc. take place. Different locations fall under different jurisdictions which means a company may have to comply with an entity, e.g., a government or risk the possibility of being fined, sued, violently attacked, etc. Ideally, there would be numerous companies producing FOSH and FOSS spread out across the world to prevent central points of failure. It's worth noting the jurisdictions these companies fall under in case you're in a certain jurisdiction they're unable to service or if you have any concerns about the jurisdictions they're associated with.

- **Distribution**: This refers to the ability of a company to ship their products to you in a private, timely, and cost effective manner. Most companies should be able to globally ship their products, but there is no guarantee this will be the case in the future. Therefore, having multiple companies to choose from is ideal. It's also worth mentioning the ability of purchasing the hardware in person using a private payment method, e.g., cash to avoid the leaking of **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)** online.

- **Support**: This refers to the lifespan of the products, i.e., the amount of time the products will be produced and sold for and the ability to provide any necessary software updates. Along with the lifespan of the products, this also refers to the ability of a company and/or the community around a company to help educate users, troubleshoot issues, etc.

- **Products**: This refers to the selection of hardware produced by a company. A wider selection provides the end user with the ability to acquire a device that fits or at least more closely fits their specific needs.

- **Supply**: This refers to the ability of a company to meet consumer demand. Ideally, a company is able to produce enough hardware to service each customer in a timely manner, but this isn't always the case especially with smaller companies focused on producing FOSH and FOSS.

- **Operating Systems (OS's)**: This refers to the OS's supported by the hardware a company produces. Ideally, the hardware would be able to support multiple FOSS OS's, e.g., multiple Linux distributions, multiple Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) OS's, etc.

- **Price**: This refers to how expensive a company's products are, shipping costs, etc.

Based on the criteria above, the ideal scenario is to have multiple companies producing a wide variety of hardware to meet the particular needs of various end users. This is why multiple companies and devices are recommended here, and these recommendations should be updated to add more devices produced by the same or new companies and to remove any current devices as needed.

## Company Recommendations

Here are some recommendations in alphabetical order of companies that produce desktops, laptops, SBCs, and mini PCs that attempt to use FOSH and FOSS when possible:

- [Banana Pi](https://www.banana-pi.org/)

- [Libre Computer](https://libre.computer/)

- [PINE64](https://www.pine64.org/)

- [Purism](https://puri.sm/)

- [Radxa](https://radxa.com/)

- [SiFive](https://www.sifive.com/)

- [System76](https://system76.com/)

<Callout client:load type="warning">
  While you can run your node on a device produced by [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/), e.g., a [Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) the hardware and firmware is closed source which presents privacy and security issues. If you're looking to run your node on an SBC, then it may be worth taking a look at using one of the alternatives discussed below.
</Callout>

<Callout client:load type="warning">
  All of these devices haven't been tested, so they may or may not run smoothly with all of the software we'll be installing. With that being said if the devices meet at least the mid-range recommendations they should work fine. If they only meet the low-end recommendations, then it's more likely you'll run into issues running your node, and you'll have to upgrade some or all of the parts sooner rather than later.
</Callout>

<Callout client:load type="tip">
  The current guide uses the [ROCKPro64](https://www.pine64.org/rockpro64/) produced by PINE64. If you want to follow along exactly, then you should use the ROCKPro64 SBC.
