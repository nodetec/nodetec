# Drives

We're now going to discuss the current low-end, mid-range, and high-end recommendations for the node's drive storage.

## Size

At the time of writing the size of the Bitcoin blockchian is 552 GB.

Therefore, the current recommendations are as follows:

- Low-end: 700 GB

- Mid-range: 1 TB

- High-end: 2+ TB

<Callout client:load type="warning">
  If you go with the current low-end recommendation, you'll have to update your drive's storage much sooner than if you go with the mid-range or high-end recommendations. 
</Callout>

## Type

The type of drive storage you use will have an effect on how long it takes to download the blockchain as well as how fast the software runs on the node.

The current recommendations are as follows:

- Low-end: HDD

- Mid-range: SATA SSD

- High-end: NVMe SSD

<Callout client:load type="warning">
  If you go with the current low-end recommendation of using a Hard Disk Drive (HDD), then the download time for the blockchain will take much longer and you may run into syncing issues.
