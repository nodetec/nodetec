# Download

As stated previously, we're going to be using the [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) operating system for this guide. Specifically, we're going to be installing the **64-bit Debian 12 (Bookworm) Minimal Server** using the network install (netinst) image which you can download from the [Network install from a minimal CD](https://www.debian.org/CD/netinst/) page on the Debian website.

A netinst image is a minimal image that allows us to boot the Debian installer and then downloads the rest of the system as needed from a repository.

Make sure to choose the appropriate image for your device's architecture. The most common of which are **AMD64** and **ARM64**.

Here are links to download the latest versions of the netinst images for the AMD64 and ARM64 architectures:

- [Debian Current AMD64 Network Install Files](https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-cd/)

- [Debian Current ARM64 Network Install Files](https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/arm64/iso-cd/)

When visiting the links scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on the `iso` file you want to use then select the directory where you want to download the image to.

We'll be using the current AMD64 image which at the time of the writing of this guide is `debian-12.0.0-amd64-netinst.iso`.

  The way Debian uses the term CD can be confusing since they use it to describe a range of things that aren't specific to just compact discs (CDs). All you need to know though is the image we downloaded can be written to a CD, digital versatile disc (DVD), or Blu-ray disc (BD) or to a universal serial bus (USB) drive. If you're interested in learning more though check out the [What is a "CD image" anyway?](https://www.debian.org/CD/faq/#what-is) section from the Debian CD FAQ.

The minimal server allows us to build a customizable server which in our case is a Bitcoin full node using only the software packages we need which doesn't currently include a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

If you prefer to use a GUI, then you can install a 64-bit Debian 12 image that comes with one, or you can manually install a GUI of your choice.

<Callout client:load type="warning">
  The set up of the node in this guide though will be under the assumption that no GUI is being used, so all of the commands will be run in a terminal.

Before proceeding with the installation, we're going to first verify the authenticity of the downloaded image.
